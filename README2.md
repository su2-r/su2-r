**About Susan Ko**

**Introduction.**

As a clinical data scientist with a strong foundation in medicine, pharmaceutical trials, and chemical engineering, I am dedicated to leveraging data-driven insights to advance healthcare.  
I have hands-on experience in clinical trial programming and RWD analysis using SAS, R, and Python, directly aligned with my clinical work. My comprehensive experience in the pharmaceutical trial lifecycle, from data generation to FDA submissions, ensures I deliver high-quality data analysis that meets regulatory standards.  
I am passionate about harnessing the power of data science and AI to revolutionize healthcare. I enjoy conducting rigorous statistical analyses to assess drug efficacy and safety, particularly using RWD from cloud-based EHR systems like epic.  
I am seeking a challenging role at a forward-thinking pharmaceutical company where I can contribute my skills to the development of innovative medicines.

**What Defines Me.**

* **Bridging the Gap Between Medicine and Data Science ðŸŒ‰**   
* **Robust Scientific Foundation ðŸ”¬**   
* **Result-Driven ðŸš€**

**My skills.**

* **Descriptive/predictive statistics and Medical Statistics,** **Real-world data(RWD):**  
  * Led analyses of over 10 Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, statistical analysis assessing safety and efficacy of the drugs using SAS and R.  
  * Enhanced team efficiency by creating custom automation tools for statistical techniques (logistic regression, Bayesian analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, survival analysis, and time-series analysis), leading to a 5% reduction in project timelines.  
  * Collaborated decision-making with clinical teams in designing study protocols, and interpreting results in clinical contexts to assess drug safety and efficacy.

* **Clinical Trial Programming:**  
  * Ensured regulatory compliance (FDA) by developing and validating statistical analysis plans (SAPs) and programming analysis datasets (ADs) according to CDISC SDTM and ADaM standards.

* **Medical Affair & Leaderships :**  
  * Experience of start-up and managing private practice.  
  * Medical literature reviews related to CMS policy; Case studies in the development of value-based care policies and guidelines.  
  * Resolved complex conflicts of interest among four stakeholders in the care system network.
